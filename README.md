Hello everyone!, welecome 
My project in Masters computer Applications(MCA)
main project Title:"# **Reviews on crop prediction using Machine Learning in Agriculture**" 
During date: 2024 March to 2024 August

Desscription : My project about the crop prediction using machine learning algorithms for Random forest and decision trees Algorithms, I developing website and webpages for crop prediction. the using technologies in the Frontend:Html, css and Javascript, Backend:python, Database:MYSQL, Dataset:csv file format and csv(comma seperated values),Tools: visual code studio, Anaconda prompt, mysql server xamp, browser.
Crop prediction is based on five key domains: yield, water, fertilizer, crop recommendation, and weather application. Generally, prediction is done using algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees to enhance accuracy and analyze historical data. This improves crop and soil conditions, helping farmers implement new features and technologies to upgrade their planning and farming practices.

Yield Prediction:
Focuses on enhancing the prediction accuracy of how much crop will be harvested.
Analyzes both the quality and quantity of the product.
Considers factors like harvested areas, planning areas, and the levels of nitrogen (%), phosphorus (%), and potash (%).
Helps improve planning and decision-making based on these parameters.

Water Prediction:
Enhances water resource management by determining how much water is needed for each crop.
Analyzes low to high water requirements based on crop growth stages, soil type, and crop types.
Aims to optimize water usage in agriculture and ensure efficient irrigation.

Fertilizer Prediction:
Enhances fertilizer management based on factors such as temperature, moisture, soil type, humidity, nitrogen, pH level, potash, and phosphorus.
Helps determine the best fertilizer for each crop, including options like urea, 47-47-47, and other fertilizers.
Ensures optimal nutrient supply to crops for better growth and yield.

Crop Recommendation:
Enhances crop recommendation by analyzing soil types to suggest the best crops for cultivation.
Aims for sustainable crop growth by recommending crops that are best suited for the soil and environmental conditions.

Weather Application:
Integrates weather analysis to provide day-to-day climate updates.
Helps predict weather conditions in advance to assist with decision-making and crop planning.
Aims to prevent losses due to bad climate conditions by improving resource management (water, fertilizer, etc.) and ensuring timely actions.
