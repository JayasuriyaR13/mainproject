<h1 style="text-align:center" >TITTLE:</h1><h3 style="text-align:center">REVIEW ON CROP PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING IN AGRICULTURE</h3>
<h4 style="text-align:left">INTRODUCTION</h4>
   <p> &emsp; &emsp; In recent years, the application of machine learning (ML) in agriculture has garnered significant attention for its potential to revolutionize crop yield prediction and optimize farming practices. This review explores the integration of ML algorithms—Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—in enhancing various aspects of agricultural management.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Agriculture, being a cornertstone of economies worldwide, faces challenges such as unpredictable weather patterns, soil variability, and the need for efficient resource management. Traditional methods for predicting crop yields and optimizing agricultural inputs often fall short in accuracy and responsiveness to changing environmental conditions. In contrast, ML algorithms offer the capability to analyze large datasets encompassing factors like historical crop yields, weather patterns, soil properties, and management practices.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The algorithms discussed—Gradient Boosting, known for its ability to handle complex relationships in data; Random Forest, which excels in ensemble learning and robustness; Decision Tree, valued for its interpretability; and KNN, effective in instance-based learning—each bring unique strengths to agricultural applications. These algorithms enable accurate prediction of crop yields, optimization of water and fertilizer usage, recommendation of suitable crop varieties based on environmental conditions, forecasting of crop prices, and integration with real-time weather data for timely decision-making.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these ML techniques in enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. By providing a comprehensive understanding of their applications and benefits, this study advocates for continued research and adoption of ML in agriculture to address global food security challenges and support farmers in making informed decisions for sustainable agricultural practices.
    </P>
<br></br>
<h4>Existing System</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Currently, agriculture relies heavily on traditional methods for predicting crop yield and managing resources like water, fertilizer, and crop selection. These methods often lack precision and fail to adapt quickly to changing environmental factors. Manual data collection and analysis are time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to suboptimal decision-making and inefficiencies in resource allocation. Moreover, the integration of weather forecasts and market data into decision-making processes is limited, hindering proactive farming practices.</p>
<br></br><h4>Proposed System</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The proposed system leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms—Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—to transform agricultural practices by enhancing predictive accuracy and optimizing resource management. By utilizing historical crop yield data, real-time weather information, soil conditions, and crop-specific characteristics, the ML models can provide actionable insights in the following areas:</li>
<li><b>Crop Yield Prediction:</b> Accurately forecast crop yields based on historical data and current environmental conditions, enabling farmers to plan planting schedules and optimize harvest expectations.</li>
<li><b>Crop Water Management:</b> Predict water requirements based on crop type, growth stage, soil moisture levels, and weather forecasts, ensuring efficient irrigation practices and water conservation.</li>
<li><b>Crop Recommendation: </b>Recommend suitable crop varieties based on soil quality, climate suitability, and market demand, aiding farmers in making informed planting decisions. </li>
<li><b>Crop Fertilizer Optimization:</b> Optimize fertilizer application by analyzing soil nutrient levels, crop nutrient requirements, and environmental factors, minimizing wastage and environmental impact.
 <li><b> Crop Price Forecasting: </b>Forecast market prices based on historical trends, demand-supply dynamics, and external factors like weather events and policy changes, assisting farmers in marketing and pricing strategies.</li>
 <li><b>weather:</b>weather application integrated with the system provides real-time weather updates and forecasts, enabling farmers to adjust their farming practices promptly in response to changing weather conditions.</p>
    <br></br><h4>Benefits of the Proposed System</h4>
<li>Enhanced Accuracy </li>
<li>Improved Efficiency</li>
<li>  Optimized Resource Use </li>
<li>Real-Time Decision Support </li>
<br></br><h4>Predicting Crop Yields with Precision</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Historically, predicting crop yields has been a challenging task due to the multitude of variables influencing agricultural production. ML algorithms offer a data-driven approach by analyzing vast datasets encompassing historical yield data, soil properties, weather patterns, and agronomic practices.</p>
	<li><b>Gradient Boosting:</b> This algorithm excels in handling complex relationships within data, making it ideal for predicting crop yields by iteratively improving model accuracy through ensemble learning techniques.</li>
	<li><b>Random Forest:</b> Utilizing the power of ensemble learning, Random Forest algorithms aggregate predictions from multiple decision trees to enhance robustness and reduce overfitting, thereby providing reliable estimates of crop yields under diverse environmental conditions.</li>
    <li><b>Decision Tree: </b>Known for its simplicity and interpretability, Decision Tree algorithms provide insights into the factors influencing crop outcomes, aiding in strategic decision-making for crop management.</li>
	<li><b>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): </b>Effective in instance-based learning, KNN algorithms identify patterns and similarities between current and historical data points to predict crop yields, offering localized insights and recommendations for optimizing farming practices.</li>

<h4>MODULE DESCRIPTION</h4>
<h5><b>Dataset Collection: </b></h5>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Data is collected from a variety of sources and prepared for data sets. And this data is used for descriptive analysis. Data is available from several online abstract sources such as Kaggle.com and data.gov.in. We will use an annual summary of crops for at least 10 years. The data sets used in this paper are soil dataset, rainfall dataset and crop yield data. </p>
<h5><b>Preprocessing step: </b></h5>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;This step is a very important step in machine learning. Preprocessing consists of inserting the missing values, the appropriate data range, and extracting the functionality. The kind of the dataset is critical to the analysis process. In this paper we have used isnull() method for checking null values and lable Encoder() for converting the categorical data into numerical data. </p>
<h5><b>Feature Selection:</b></h5> 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Feature extraction should simplify the amount of data involved to represent a large data set. The soil and crop characteristics extracted from the pre-treatment phase constitute the final set of training. These characteristics include the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Here, we have used Random Forest Classifier() method for feature selection. This method selects the features based on the entropy value i.e., the attribute which is having more entropy value is selected as important feature for yield prediction.</p>

<h5><b>Split the Dataset into Train and Test Set: </b></h5>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;This step includes training and testing of input data. The loaded data is divided into two sets, such as training data and test data, with a division ratio of 80% or 20%, such as 0.8 or 0.2. In a learning set, a classifier is used to form the available input data. In this step, create the classifier's support data and preconceptions to approximate and classify the function. During the test phase, the data is tested. The final data is formed during preprocessing and is processed by the machine learning module. </p>
<h5><b>Algorithm Applying</b></h5>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Applying machine learning algorithms to the prepared datasets involves fine-tuning the models and optimizing hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy. The choice of algorithms and optimization techniques depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired prediction outcomes. Ensuring the robustness and scalability of the algorithms is essential for handling large-scale datasets and diverse agricultural scenarios.</p>
<h5><b>Prediction:</b></h5>
<P>&emsp;&emsp;Generating accurate crop yield predictions based on the output of trained machine learning models is the ultimate goal of the prediction phase. These predictions provide valuable insights for farmers, agricultural policymakers, and stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making and resource allocation. However, challenges such as model interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and validation of predictions need to be addressed to ensure the reliability and applicability of the predictions in real-world agricultural settings.</p>
